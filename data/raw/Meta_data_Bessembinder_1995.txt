Description: 
Column header						Units									Description
Original_region						Character								Indicated the region these data relate to*
Reference_where_data_were_collated			Character								Reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Website_of_source_of_collated_data			Character								Website of the reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Primary_reference_of_dataset				Character								Indicates the primary reference where data were originally taken from. 
Original_crop						Character								Original crop name used in report.
Original_crop_component					Character								Crop component information added by Cameron Ludemann (as either Crop_products or Crop_residues)
variable						Character								Indicates the variable by which the value relates to**.
value							Numeric									Numeric value associated with the variable.
Table_number						Numeric									Indicates the table number from this reference where the data came from.

*Note Bessembinder searched for data relevant to Costa Rica. Most datasets had nutrient concentration data missing and only two datasets were found (see pg 52 of the article) as follows: 
Dataset 1: Erenstein 1989 was collected from the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica on 34 farms in 1987 on 6 soil types. 
Dataset 2: Chin-Fo_Sieew 1994 was from the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica from a fertilizer trial conducted in 1991 on a relative fertile and an infertile site. Gran yield and harvest index in this dataset may have been lower than dataaset 1 due to bird damage. 

**variables were as follows: 
variable						Units									Description
N_pc							Numeric, percentage of dry matter as nitrogen				Mean percentage of dry matter as nitrogen.
P_pc							Numeric, percentage of dry matter as elemental phosphorus		Mean percentage of dry matter as elemental phosphorus.
K_pc							Numeric, percentage of dry matter as elemental potassium		Mean percentage of dry matter as elemental potassium.
N_pc_sd							Numeric, percentage of dry matter as nitrogen				Standard deviation of percentage of dry matter as nitrogen.
P_pc_sd							Numeric, percentage of dry matter as elemental phosphorus		Standard deviation of percentage of dry matter as elemental phosphorus.
K_pc_sd 						Numeric, percentage of dry matter as elemental potassium		Standard deviation of percentage of dry matter as elemental potassium.
N_pc_min						Numeric, percentage of dry matter as nitrogen				Minimum value of percentage of dry matter as nitrogen.
P_pc_min						Numeric, percentage of dry matter as elemental phosphorus		Minimum value of percentage of dry matter as elemental phosphorus.
K_pc_min 						Numeric, percentage of dry matter as elemental potassium		Minimum value of percentage of dry matter as elemental potassium.
No_samples						Numeric, number of samples						Number of samples that went into the mean values.
Yield_kg_DM_ha						Numeric, yield in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.			Mean grain (crop product) yield in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
Yield_kg_DM_ha_sd					Numeric, yield in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.			Standard deviation of grain (crop product) yield in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
HI							Numeric, unitless proportion.						Mean harvest index (as proportion).
HI_sd							Numeric, unitless, proportion.						Standard deviation of harvest index (as proportion).

##Data were manually taken from the original pdf and converted to one combined excel file for conversion into a csv file.
