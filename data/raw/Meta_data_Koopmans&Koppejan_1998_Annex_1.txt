Primary_reference_of_dataset		Characters					Primary sources of data from which the data came from.These references were cited by Koopmans & Koppejan (1998) in their collation table. 
Reference_where_data_were_collated	Characters					Details of the Koopmans & Koppejan (1998) conference paper from which the collation table of data was available to get data for this dataset.
Website_of_source_of_collated_data	Characters					Website of the Koopmans & Koppejan (1998) conference paper 
Residue_to_product_ratio		Numeric						A residue to product ratio number for the various crops. The ratio was crop component divided by the crop product.
Moisture_content_pc			Numeric	percentage of fresh weight		Moisture concentration of crop component.
Carbon_pc				Numeric	percentage of fresh weight		Carbon concentration of crop component.	
Nitrogen_pc				Numeric	percentage of fresh weight		Nitrogen concentration of crop component.
Harvest_index				Numeric	unitless				Harvest index interpolated from residue to product ratio. The equation for harvest index was 1/(1+Residue to product ratio)
