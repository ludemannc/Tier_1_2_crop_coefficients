Description: 
Column header						Units									Description
Year							Numeric									Year by which the wheat samples were made. Note that the sowing date of these wheat may be the previous year(s).
Original_country					Character								Indicated the country these data relate to*
Original_state					        Character								Indicated the state these data relate to*
Sample_site						Character								Indicated original sample site these data relate to*
Original_region						Character								Indicated the region these data relate to*
Reference_where_data_were_collated			Character								Reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Website_of_source_of_collated_data			Character								Website of the reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Primary_reference_of_dataset				Character								Indicates the primary reference where data were originally taken from. 
Original_crop						Character								Original crop name used in report.
Original_crop_component					Character								Crop component information added by Cameron Ludemann (as either Crop_products or Crop_residues)
variable						Character								Indicates the variable by which the value relates to**.
value							Numeric									Numeric value associated with the variable.
Table_number						Numeric									Indicates the table number from this reference where the data came from.

*Note that this study took wheat samples from the North Macedonian city of Skopje. But according to Angeleska et al (2021) North Macedonia is self-sufficient in wheat production so the measures made in this article should be presentative of what was grown in 2019.
