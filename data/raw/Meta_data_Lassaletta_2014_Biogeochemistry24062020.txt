#Data contained in file:
#"Missing code"="*" where the "*" indicates a nutrient content was estimated "by analogy to similar items"

#Column description: 
Column header				Units						Description
FAO_CODES				Number denoting crop classification		See:Indicative Crop Classification Version 1.0 (ICC) http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/ess/documents/world_census_of_agriculture/appendix3_r7.pdf
ITEM					Crop name + component description if applicable	See:Indicative Crop Classification Version 1.0 (ICC) http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/ess/documents/world_census_of_agriculture/appendix3_r7.pdf
N_content_pc				Percentage of fresh weight as nitrogen         	Nitrogen content of item (original FAO data-from https://www.fao.org/3/x9892e/x9892e00.pdf- were in protein percentages which appear to have been converted to nitrogen  percentage using factor of 6.25-at least this ws the case for wheat and barley)
Reference				Last name and date of reference			Last name and date of reference. 


#Methodology: The original data was in a xlsx file on the publishers website, so to preserve the data in a reusable format I 
converted it to a csv file after deleting the first and last rows (which included info on the reference and 
a description of the "*" symbol respectively). I also ensured the column headers had no spaces in between words by adding "_" symbols
between words.
