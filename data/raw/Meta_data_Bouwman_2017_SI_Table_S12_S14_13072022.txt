Column header						Units									Description
Reference_where_data_were_collated			Character								Reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Website_of_source_of_collated_data			Character								Website of the reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Crop_number						Numeric 								Value for sequential unique number of row for each crop	
Crop_component						Character								Indicates whether the nutrient concentration data is for a component that is Crop_products or Crop_residues
Crop_group_1						Numeric, integer							Number aligns to Crop_group_name_1 whereby 1=Upland crops, 2=Legumes, 3=Rice.
Crop_group_2						Numeric, integer							Number aligns to Crop_group_name_2 whereby 1=Temperate cereals, 2=Rice, 3=Maize, 4=Tropical cereals, 5=Pulses, 6=Roots and tuber crops, 7=Oil crops and 8=Other crops. These are the same categories as used for the Crop_residue 'Crop' information.
