#Column description: 
Column header						Units												Description
Item Code						Numeric												Food and Agriculture Organisation Item numeric code related to crop type
Item							Character											Food and Agriculture Organisation Item character code related to crop type
Source							Character											Indicates where the original data were sourced from.
Crop							Character											Indicates what crop and crop components were used to estimate the Grain and Plant nutrient concentration components. Eg Wheat (spring) grain + Wheat straw per unit of grain yield meant for N_Grain the N concentration was from Wheat (spring) grain and for N_plant the Wheat straw per unit of grain yield value was used. 									
Average							Numeric, 1 or 0											Is a binomial indicator of whether a mean of other values (across a selection of other crops) was used to interpolate the nutrient concentration of this crop. A zero (0) indicates an average value was not used. A '1' indicates that a mean value was used. For example, there were no data for Quinoa, so it received values that were average across Other cereals. 
N_Grain							Numeric, kg N per metric tonne grain fresh weight						Nitrogen concentration on a kg of nitrogen per tonne of grain fresh weight basis.
N_Plant							Numeric, kg N per metric tonne crop residue fresh weight					Nitrogen concentration on a kg of nitrogen per tonne of crop residue fresh weight basis.
N							Numeric, kg N per metric tonne crop product dry matter + metric tonne crop residue fresh weight	Total nitrogen (in kg) per 1 tonne of crop product fresh weight plus 1 tonne of crop residue. Note this does not appear to account for harvest index of the different crops.  
P_Grain							Numeric, kg P per metric tonne grain fresh weight						Elemental phosphorus concentration on a kg of elemental phosphorus per tonne of grain fresh weight basis.
P_Plant							Numeric, kg P per metric tonne crop residue fresh weight					Elemental phosphorus concentration on a kg of elemental phosphorus per tonne of crop residue fresh weight basis.
P							Numeric, kg P per metric tonne crop product fresh weight + metric tonne crop residue fresh weight	Total elemental phosphorus (in kg) per 1 tonne of crop product fresh weight plus 1 tonne of crop residue. Note this does not appear to account for harvest index of the different crops.  
K_Grain							Numeric, kg K per metric tonne grain fresh weight						Elemental potassium concentration on a kg of elemental potassium per tonne of grain fresh weight basis.
K_Plant							Numeric, kg K per metric tonne crop residue fresh weight					Elemental potassium  concentration on a kg of elemental potassium  per tonne of crop residue fresh weight basis.
K							Numeric, kg S per metric tonne crop product fresh weight + metric tonne crop residue fresh weight	Total elemental potassium (in kg) per 1 tonne of crop product fresh weight plus 1 tonne of crop residue. Note this does not appear to account for harvest index of the different crops.  
S_Grain							Numeric, kg S per metric tonne grain fresh weight						Sulphur concentration on a kg of sulphur per tonne of grain fresh weight basis.
S_Plant							Numeric, kg S per metric tonne crop residue fresh weight					Sulphur concentration on a kg of sulphur per tonne of crop residue fresh weight basis.
S							Numeric, kg S per metric tonne crop product fresh weight + metric tonne crop residue fresh weightTotal sulphur (in kg) per 1 tonne of crop product fresh weight plus 1 tonne of crop residue. Note this does not appear to account for harvest index of the different crops.  
Legume							Numeric, 1 or 0											Binomial indicator of whether the crop is a legume (1) or not a legume (0).						
Primary_reference_of_dataset				Character											Primary reference from which the data came from
Reference_where_data_were_collated			Character											Reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Website_of_source_of_collated_data			Character											Website of the reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset

##Data were manually taken from the original csv file with some reference information added (the 3 right most columns).

Nathan Wanner said these values are on a nutrient concentration on a fresh weight basis.
