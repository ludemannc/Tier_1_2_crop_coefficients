Variable description: 				Description:
Percentage_dry_matter_as_carbohydrates =	Percentage of dry matter as carbohydrates.
Percentage_dry_matter_as_protein=		Percentage of dry matter as protein.
Nitrogen_to_protein_factor=			The nitrogen to protein factor for converting nitrogen percentage to protein percentage. A value of 6.25 was first used (pre 27/9/2023) to allow interpolation of nitrogen percentage of dry matter, however upon rereading the Sinclair and De Wit (1975) article Unkovich refers to it became clear they used a 15% N of protein value which is 100/15=6.67 factor. So a value of 6.67 was used post 27/9/2023. 								
Percentage_dry_matter_as_nitrogen=		The percentage of dry matter as nitrogen (based on percentage of dry matter as protein divided by the Nitogen_to_protein_factor).
Percentage_dry_matter_as_lipid=			Percentage of dry matter as lipids.
Percentage_dry_matter_as_ash=   		Percentage of dry matter as ash.
Biomass_productivity_g_per_g=			Biomass productivity in milligrams per gram. For more information see Sinclair and de Wit (1975) Science 189, 565-567 available at: https://edepot.wur.nl/198120.
Nitrogen_requirement_of_crop_mg_per_g =		Nitrogen requirement of crop in milligrams per gram. For more information see Sinclair and de Wit (1975) Science 189, 565-567 available at: https://edepot.wur.nl/198120.
Moisture_percentage_crop_products=		Moisture percentage of crop products.
Mean_Above_ground_biomass_kg_DM_ha=		Mean above ground biomass in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
n_Above_ground_biomass_kg_DM_ha=		Number of values used to estimate mean value for above ground biomass in Table 5.
Minimum_Above_ground_biomass_kg_DM_ha=		Minimum value for above ground biomass in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
Maximum_Above_ground_biomass_kg_DM_ha=		Maximum value for above ground biomass in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
Mean_Grain_yield_kg_DM_ha=			Mean value of grain (crop product) yield in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
n_Grain_yield_kg_DM_ha=				Number of values used to estimate mean value of grain yield in Table 5.
Minimum_Grain_yield_kg_DM_ha=			Minimum value of grain yield in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
Maximum_Grain_yield_kg_DM_ha=			Maximum value of grain yield in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
Mean_Harvest_index=				Mean harvest index as a proportion. 
n_Harvest_index=				Number of values used to estimate mean value for harvest index in Table 5.
Minimum_Harvest_index=				Minimum value of harvest index, as a proportion.
Maximum_Harvest_index=				Maximum value of harvest index, as a proportion.
Mean_HI=					Mean harvest as a proportion. 

##Data were manually taken from pdf tables of results and inputted to an excel where they were converted 
to a format suitable for a csv file.

Note the change in Nitrogen_to_protein_factor: on the 27/9/2023 this was changed from 6.25 to 6.67 based on a more in depth reading of the Sinclair and De Wit (1975) article that Unkovich refers to.
