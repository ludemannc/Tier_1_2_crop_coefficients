Variable description: 				Description:
Percentage_dry_matter_as_carbohydrates =	Percentage of dry matter as carbohydrates.
Percentage_dry_matter_as_protein=		Percentage of dry matter as protein.
Nitrogen_to_protein_factor=			The nitrogen to protein factor for converting nitrogen percentage to protein percentage. This value (Jones factor of 6.25 across all crop) was added by Cameron Ludemann to allow interpolation of nitrogen percentage of dry matter.								
Percentage_dry_matter_as_nitrogen=		The percentage of dry matter as nitrogen (based on percentage of dry matter as protein divided by the Nitogen_to_protein_factor).
Percentage_dry_matter_as_lipid=			Percentage of dry matter as lipids.
Percentage_dry_matter_as_ash=   		Percentage of dry matter as ash.
Biomass_productivity_g_per_g=			Biomass productivity in milligrams per gram. For more information see Sinclair and de Wit (1975) Science 189, 565-567 available at: https://edepot.wur.nl/198120.
Nitrogen_requirement_of_crop_mg_per_g =		Nitrogen requirement of crop in milligrams per gram. For more information see Sinclair and de Wit (1975) Science 189, 565-567 available at: https://edepot.wur.nl/198120.
Moisture_percentage_crop_products=		Moisture percentage of crop products.
Mean_Above_ground_biomass_kg_DM_ha=		Mean above ground biomass in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
n_Above_ground_biomass_kg_DM_ha=		Number of values used to estimate mean value for above ground biomass in Table 5.
Minimum_Above_ground_biomass_kg_DM_ha=		Minimum value for above ground biomass in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
Maximum_Above_ground_biomass_kg_DM_ha=		Maximum value for above ground biomass in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
Mean_Grain_yield_kg_DM_ha=			Mean value of grain (crop product) yield in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
n_Grain_yield_kg_DM_ha=				Number of values used to estimate mean value of grain yield in Table 5.
Minimum_Grain_yield_kg_DM_ha=			Minimum value of grain yield in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
Maximum_Grain_yield_kg_DM_ha=			Maximum value of grain yield in kilograms of dry matter per hectare.
Mean_Harvest_index=				Mean harvest index as a proportion. 
n_Harvest_index=				Number of values used to estimate mean value for harvest index in Table 5.
Minimum_Harvest_index=				Minimum value of harvest index, as a proportion.
Maximum_Harvest_index=				Maximum value of harvest index, as a proportion.
Mean_HI=					Mean harvest as a proportion.
