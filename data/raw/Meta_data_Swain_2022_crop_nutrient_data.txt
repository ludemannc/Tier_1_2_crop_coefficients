Description: 
Column header						Units									Description
Reference_where_data_were_collated			Character								Reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Website_of_source_of_collated_data			Character								Website of the reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Primary_reference_of_dataset				Character								Indicates the primary reference where data were originally taken from. 
Original_country					Character								Indicates country these data relate to.
Original_state						Character								Indicates state in India where these data relate to.
Original_region						Character								Indicated the Country_state where these data relate to*.
Original_crop						Character								Original crop name used in report.
Original_crop_component					Character								Crop component information added by Cameron Ludemann (as either Crop_products or Crop_residues)
variable						Character								Indicates the variable by which the value relates to**.
value							Numeric									Numeric value associated with the variable.
Table_number						Numric									Indicates the table number from this reference where the data came from.

*Note that Cameron Ludemann contacted two of the authors of this dataset (Chris Jones and Braja Swain at GCIAR) to ask if the values shown in the report represent what is actually grown in Odisha (as it could include some imported feeds).
Braja's reply was as follows:  "Yes, most of crops (green and dry forages) are grown in Odisha. Around 50% of concentrate feed is imported from Other states of India (i.e. Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and other neighbour state)." 

**variables were as follows: 
variable						Units									Description

Protein_pc_sd						Percentage of dry matter as protein					The standard deviation of the percentage of dry matter as protein.
Protein_pc_max						Percentage of dry matter as protein					The maximum value of the percentage of dry matter as protein.
Protein_pc_min						Percentage of dry matter as protein					The minimum value of the percentage of dry matter as protein.
