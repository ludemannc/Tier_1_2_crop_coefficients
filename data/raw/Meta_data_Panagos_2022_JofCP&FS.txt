Column header						Units								Description
Region							Character							Region/country these data relates to
Original_crop_category					Character							The original aggregate crop category used by Panagos et al (2022).
Original_crop						Character							The original crop category used by Panagos et al (2022).
Crop_component						Character							The crop component (either as 'Crop_products' or 'Crop_residues') information added by Cameron Ludemann to this dataset.
P_pc_DM							Numeric, percentage DM as elemental phosphorus (P)		Percentage of dry matter as elemental phosphorus. 
sd_P_pc_DM						Numeric, standard deviation of percentage DM as elemental P 	Standard deviation of the percentage of dry matter as elemental phosphorus.
No_samples_P_pc_DM					Numeric, number of samples used to get P_pc_DM			Number of samples used to estimate mean P_pc_DM and sd_P_pc_DM.

Ratio_crop_residue_to_crop_products			Numeric, ratio							The ratio of crop residue to crop products. 
Harvest_index						Numeric, unitless proportion					The harvest index of the crop based on the Ratio_crop_residue_to_crop_products (Cameron Ludemann made this interpolation). 
Ratio_residues_removed_from_field			Numeric, ratio							The ratio/proportion of crop residues removed from the field.
Reference_where_data_were_collated			Character							Reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
