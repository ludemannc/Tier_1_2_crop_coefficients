Column header						Units					Description
Reference_where_data_were_collated			Character				Reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Website_of_source_of_collated_data			Character				Website of the reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Primary_reference_of_dataset				Character				Indicates the primary reference where data were originally taken from.
Original_crop						Character				Original crop name used in report.
Original_crop_component					Character				Original crop component information from this reference.
N_pc_min_90pc_CI					Numeric, % dry matter as nitrogen	Minimum value for nitrogen concentration of crop component. Note (as per pg 1-2 of Nijhof (1987)) 'the established ranges cover 90% [confidence interval, CI] of the values found, i.e. the upper and lower extremes were excluded'.				
N_pc_max_90pc_CI					Numeric, % dry matter as nitrogen	Maximum value for nitrogen concentration of crop component. Note (as per pg 1-2 of Nijhof (1987)) 'the established ranges cover 90% [confidence interval, CI] of the values found, i.e. the upper and lower extremes were excluded'.	
P_pc_min_90pc_CI					Numeric, % dry matter as elemental P	Minimum value for elemental phosphorus concentration of crop component. Note (as per pg 1-2 of Nijhof (1987)) 'the established ranges cover 90% [confidence interval, CI] of the values found, i.e. the upper and lower extremes were excluded'.				
P_pc_max_90pc_CI					Numeric, % dry matter as elemental P	Maximum value for elemental phosphorus concentration of crop component. Note (as per pg 1-2 of Nijhof (1987)) 'the established ranges cover 90% [confidence interval, CI] of the values found, i.e. the upper and lower extremes were excluded'.	
K_pc_min_90pc_CI					Numeric, % dry matter as elemental K	Minimum value for elemental potassium concentration of crop component. Note (as per pg 1-2 of Nijhof (1987)) 'the established ranges cover 90% [confidence interval, CI] of the values found, i.e. the upper and lower extremes were excluded'.				
K_pc_max_90pc_CI					Numeric, % dry matter as elemental K	Maximum value for elemental potassium concentration of crop component. Note (as per pg 1-2 of Nijhof (1987)) 'the established ranges cover 90% [confidence interval, CI] of the values found, i.e. the upper and lower extremes were excluded'.
