Column header						Units						Description
Original_region						Character					Original name of region data purported to represent.
Reference_where_data_were_collated			Character					Reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Website_of_source_of_collated_data			Character					Website of the reference by which the data were collated for use in this dataset
Primary_reference_of_dataset				Character					Indicates the primary reference where data were originally taken from.
Pub_page_Number						Numeric						Numeric value indicating page in reference where data were taken from.				
Original_crop						Character					Original crop name used in report.
Original_crop_component					Character					Original crop component information from this reference.
HI							Numeric, proportion				Harvest index value (proportion of above ground biomass as crop products). This ewas a backcalculation of the original grain to residue ratio data seen in the dataset. 
N_content_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	Nitrogen concentration of component in kg nitrogen per tonne of dry matter*. 
P2O5_content_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	P2O5 concentration of component in kg P2O5 per tonne of dry matter*. 
K2O_content_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	K2O concentration of component in kg K2O per tonne of dry matter*. 
Ca_content_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	Ca concentration of component in kg Ca per tonne of dry matter*.
Mg_content_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	Mg concentration of component in kg Mg per tonne of dry matter*.

Cu_content_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	Cu concentration of component in kg Cu per tonne of dry matter*.
Mn_content_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	Mn concentration of component in kg Mn per tonne of dry matter*.
Zn_content_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	Zn concentration of component in kg Zn per tonne of dry matter*.
Fe_uptake_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	Fe uptake in component in kg Fe per tonne of dry matter*.
Mn_uptake_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	Mn uptake in component in kg Mn per tonne of dry matter*.
Cu_uptake_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	Cu uptake in component in kg Cu per tonne of dry matter*.
B_uptake_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	B uptake in component in kg B per tonne of dry matter*.
Mo_uptake_kg_per_t					Numeric kg nutrient per tonne dry matter	Mo update in component in kg Mo per tonne of dry matter*.

*Note that Roy et al (2016) does not explicitly state whether nutrient concentration is per tonne dry matter or tonne fresh weight.The Zublena (1991/1997) reference Roy et al (2016) refers to is not available so this cannot be decided for certain. 

#Data were manually taken from pdf tables of results and inputted to an excel where they were converted 
to a format suitable for a csv file.
